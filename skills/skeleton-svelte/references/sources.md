# Sources, compatibility evidence, and distribution

Reference baseline as of **2026-10-18**: Skeleton core and Svelte components
**5.0.1**, Svelte **5.57.2**, SvelteKit **3.1.0**, Tailwind CSS **4.3.3**.
Exact packages establish API and dependency contracts, not upstream certification
of every application, deployment, or accessibility requirement.

## Exclusive framework scope

Skill version **3.0** targets **SvelteKit 3.1+ exclusively**. The supported
implementation path uses modern configuration, imports, state, navigation and
forms. Older framework references identify migration inputs or patterns to
replace; they are not alternative recipes. This policy supersedes earlier
legacy-framework preservation guidance without relabeling historical test runs.

The scope cutover changed instructions, not executable examples or dependency
pins. A fresh exact-baseline fixture passed `npm run check` (**173 files,
0 errors, 0 warnings**) and client/server production builds. Production preview
returned SSR HTML and exercised native HTML POSTs: whitespace failure returned
400 with the exact raw value; valid input returned 200 with its greeting.
Skill-format and local link/fence checks passed. Adapter-auto still had no
production target, and the build emitted the environmental color warning.
Later releases require matching API/source checks; these results certify neither
future releases nor a production deployment.

## Choose the authority before copying code

1. **Inspect the application's resolved packages first.** Lockfile and installed
   metadata determine availability; manifest ranges and documentation titles do not.
2. **Use exact published packages for exports, declarations, CSS, peers, and
   engines.** Read implementation when types omit behavior. Internal inspection
   paths are not supported application import specifiers.
3. **Use current official Skeleton v5 documentation for intent and examples.**
   Check examples against the installed version. Archived v4 documentation is
   staged migration evidence, not the v5 destination API.
4. **Use version-appropriate official framework documentation.** Rolling pages
   can change; compare signatures with exact installed Svelte/Kit/Tailwind packages.
   This skill targets Kit 3.1+ exclusively, regardless of upstream Skeleton's
   broader framework support. Older conventions are migration/avoidance context.
5. **Treat search, Context7, and supplied research as discovery/secondary sources.**
   Follow underlying sources and resolve conflicts using exact package evidence.
   Scores, labels, statistics, and prose do not establish API compatibility.

## Secondary research and corrections

The supplied Gemini research, [Architectural Evolution and Design System
Engineering in Skeleton v5](https://share.gemini.google/2iTB8QXtd8cZ), informed
research questions, not API authority. Its shared page redirected to
[Gemini's canonical share](https://gemini.google.com/share/0b64a27b7a4e).
The following corrections also apply when official prose conflicts with packages:

- Accordion uses `value: string[]`, `onValueChange`, and `e.value`, not
  `open/onOpenChange/e.change`. The exported step component is `Steps`, not `Stepper`.
- Export spelling is `QrCode`, not `QRCode`. Verify names from runtime exports,
  not documentation-navigation totals or assumed component counts.
- `createToaster` creates a store, not an enforced process singleton. Keep stores
  instance-owned; share through layout context when needed, with one renderer per
  store. Never put user-specific notification queues in a mutable SSR singleton.
- Tokens, contrast assignments, OKLCH, and framework components do not guarantee
  accessibility. Measure rendered contrast and test keyboard/focus behavior.
- Do not treat preview/beta labels, browser-support tables, utility/property/theme
  totals, adoption statistics, or trend claims as stable package contracts. Use
  versioned evidence for relevant features and test target browsers. Local preview
  examples do not establish persistence or production readiness.
- Provider factories need required IDs; element snippets must forward supplied
  attributes. Custom example presets and corner tokens do not imply shipped
  utilities or automatic global geometry. See the relevant component/style guide.

### Supplemental research review

The user-supplied **`temp_supp_research-doc.md`**, titled “Expressive UI
Development Reference” with a **2026-10-18** cutoff, is unvetted secondary research.
It explicitly disclaims compilation/browser testing. The skill is self-contained;
that temporary authoring input is not an installation prerequisite.

| Research area | Disposition |
| --- | --- |
| Versions, package responsibilities, installation, themes, migrations | Retain exact-baseline optional-peer, adapter, CSS-import, and token qualifications. The skill's exclusive Kit 3.1+ scope supersedes earlier legacy-framework preservation policy. |
| Compound component examples | Correct `<Switch.Root>` to callable `<Switch>`; 5.0.1's [Switch anatomy](https://unpkg.com/@skeletonlabs/skeleton-svelte@5.0.1/dist/components/switch/modules/anatomy.d.ts) has no `Root` member. Documentation-entry totals are not runtime export totals. |
| Reactivity, motion, and route continuity | Validate against exact Svelte/Kit declarations and implementation; see [purposeful motion](sveltekit.md#purposeful-motion). Do not copy hardcoded reusable disclosure IDs or assume skipped visual transitions imply failed navigation. |
| Tailwind extensibility and browser support | Add CSS-first extension guidance and cumulative browser constraints in [styling](styling.md). Keep Skeleton as the authoritative theme layer. |
| Expressive design, feedback, and performance | Add [purposeful feedback and measured performance](design.md#purposeful-feedback-and-motion). Retain static reading surfaces and truthful state; editorial trends, neurochemical claims, and universal timing ranges are not requirements. |
| Motion, focus, dragging, and accessibility levels | Add precise safeguards in [accessibility](accessibility.md#contrast-motion-and-scale), not an implied accessibility certification. |
| Maintenance and verification | Existing exact-package, native/enhanced-form, hydration, responsive, and evidence-limit procedures remain applicable. Only executed supplemental checks are recorded below. |

Context7 is discovery evidence; primary sources and the exact installed packages
resolve API questions. Motion remains optional within the Kit 3.1+ target and
does not require experimental framework features. No Kit 2 implementation path
is supported by this skill.

## Offline installed-package inspection

1. Read manifest, lockfile, and installed metadata through the actual workspace
   dependency layout, including symlinks. Record resolved versions and overrides;
   preserve package manager and lockfile.
2. Read `exports`/`types`. In component 5.0.1, start at `dist/index.d.ts` and
   `dist/index.js`, then follow relative declarations and source. Inspect required
   props, callback payloads, snippet tuples, child members, and bindability.
3. Follow inherited Zag contracts through the installed dependency version, not
   rolling Zag documentation. Read implementation for rendered tags, hidden/native
   inputs, default styling, event forwarding, and lifecycle behavior.
4. Inspect core `src/index.css`, its imported utilities, and `src/themes/*.css`,
   plus Svelte package `dist/index.css`. Core exports only its root, themes, and
   package metadata; `/optional/presets` is obsolete. Inspect installed Svelte/Kit
   `types/index.d.ts` for framework contracts.
5. Compare only affected contracts when versions differ. Do not silently change
   dependencies to fit an example. Name missing evidence rather than inventing APIs.

## Exact compatibility baseline and observed evidence

| Dependency/runtime | Exact baseline |
| --- | --- |
| Node / npm observed during installation | `24.15.0` / `12.2.0` |
| `@skeletonlabs/skeleton` / `@skeletonlabs/skeleton-svelte` | `5.0.1` / `5.0.1` |
| `svelte` / `@sveltejs/kit` | `5.57.2` / `3.1.0` |
| `vite` / `@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte` | `8.3.4` / `7.3.1` |
| `typescript` / `svelte-check` | `6.0.3` / `4.7.7` |
| `tailwindcss` / `@tailwindcss/vite` | `4.3.3` / `4.3.3` |
| `@sveltejs/adapter-auto` / `@tailwindcss/forms` | `8.0.0` / `0.5.11` |

Core requires Tailwind `^4.0.0`; components require Svelte `^5.40.0`. Kit 3.1.0
requires Node `>=22.17`, Svelte `^5.57.1`, Vite `^8.0.12`, and Svelte Vite plugin
`^7.0.0`; TypeScript `^6.0.0` is optional. Combined tool engines permit maintained
Node 22 from 22.17 or Node 24+; use a maintained compatible release. JavaScript-only
apps need not add TypeScript. Preserve the application's production adapter.
These pins and peers do not certify every version in their ranges.

**Original v5 baseline checks (2026-10-18):**

- The isolated installation added 130 packages without forced peers, using the
  exact versions above.
- Eighteen complete documented components were extracted into the fixture.
  `npm run check` checked 945 files with 0 errors and 0 warnings.
- Client and server production builds passed. `adapter-auto` found no production
  target; the environment emitted a `NO_COLOR`/`FORCE_COLOR` warning.
- `skills-ref validate` passed. Structural checks covered 11 Markdown files,
  99 local links, and 45 code fences with no failures.
- A consumer type proof accepted the catalog's 31 components, 200 listed anatomy
  members, and 30 helper exports. This establishes type availability, not runtime
  coverage of every export.

**Observed browser interactions:** Chromium **155.0.8059.84**, production preview:

| Scenario | Observed result |
| --- | --- |
| Tabs | Click, ArrowLeft, Home, and End updated focus, panels, and controlled state. |
| Accordion | Click selected cancel; Space collapsed the controlled value to none. |
| Switch/native form | Space changed state; `FormData` omitted unchecked notifications and included checked notifications as `on`. |
| Tooltip | Focus exposed portalled help with matching `aria-describedby`; Escape hid it. |
| Dialog | Title/description, initial Cancel focus, Tab containment, Escape focus restoration, Cancel, local confirmation, and 320px viewport fit passed. |
| Toast | The instance-owned group rendered title/description; Enter on its named Close removed it before auto-expiry. |
| Combobox | Keyboard selection, true empty results, full-list reopening, pointer/Space Clear, and disjoint controls passed. Open and closed popups fit 320px; controls had no overflow at 320, 375, and 1280px. |
| Pagination | Native page buttons accepted Enter; row slices, last-page boundaries, size reset, zero/one-row states, and parent-form non-submission passed. |
| Provider/custom element | Explicit-ID Tooltip provider, forwarded button attributes, getter state, and Escape worked. |
| Repeated instances | 55 IDs were unique; labels resolved; second Tabs/ProfilePreview/Dialog state remained isolated; Summary links focused their own heading. |
| Native field groups | Both documented grouped-field labels focused their own inputs; coordinated `field-xl`/`btn-xl` controls measured 42px high. |
| Native dialog/disclosure | `showModal`, Escape, dialog-form results, and independent exclusive disclosure groups worked. |
| Theme/motion | Light/dark pairings and independent local-scheme brand colors changed; application reduced-motion rules disabled native transitions. |
| Svelte state | Native parent binding updated the derived counter; route state rendered; media changes updated mounted state. |
| Server forms | Enhanced failure retained spaces and focused the invalid field. Native HTML POSTs preserved spaces and all 81 overlength characters; valid, missing, and file values followed the declared policy. |
| No JavaScript | Required validation, failed/successful native POSTs, disabled local previews/filters, four SSR briefs, and native navigation worked. |
| Responsive shell | Apply/reset/search/status/empty states, skip-link focus, and mobile section links worked; no overflow at 320/375/768/1280px. Narrow/wide screenshots were inspected. |
| Kit 3 navigation | Shallow address-bar metadata stayed distinct from rendered `page.url`; `refreshAll()` worked; persisted state survived reload. |

The hydrated preview had no recorded runtime or hydration errors. Script requests
were deliberately blocked in the no-JavaScript run; protocol inspection reported
`blockedReason: csp`, with no loading failures after JavaScript was re-enabled.
These observations do not certify a full contrast, forced-colors, text-zoom, or
screen-reader audit, every exported/beta component, framework file-upload or
monorepo runtime, concurrent authenticated-session isolation, or deployment.
`adapter-auto` had no production target. Local confirmations do not establish
persistence; historical v3 checks were not relabeled as v5 evidence.

### Supplemental validation — 2026-10-18

The supplemental review kept the exact dependency baseline above. A fresh
installation added **130 packages** without forced peers on Node **24.15.0** /
npm **12.2.0**. Eighteen named component files and their route/CSS examples were
extracted into a disposable application; the optional route-motion layout
replaced, rather than concatenated with, its baseline layout.

- `npm run check`: **926 files, 0 errors, 0 warnings**.
- `npm run build`: client/server production builds passed. `adapter-auto` again
  had no production target; the environment emitted the color-variable warning.
- `skills-ref validate skills/skeleton-svelte` and local link/fence checks passed.
- Generated Tailwind **4.3.3** CSS confirmed `@container-size` (and absence of
  `size-container`), documented scrollbar utilities, `zoom-125`, `tab-4`, custom
  easing, and an exclusive class in an explicitly registered external source.

Chromium **155.0.8059.84** production-preview checks covered:

| Scenario | Observed result |
| --- | --- |
| Spring selection | Text/pressed state, independent instances, eight rapid Space activations, destruction/remount, and live reduced-motion changes worked without unhandled rejections. |
| Initial reduced motion / no JavaScript | Preference set before hydration kept scale neutral and skipped route decoration. Without JavaScript, local selection controls remained disabled in SSR output. |
| Native route continuity | Native transitions, Kit 3 shallow filtering/state retention, route titles, and Back/Forward worked. Unsupported API and injected synchronous setup failure still navigated. |
| Native rejection/cancellation paths | Explicit skip, duplicate-name snapshot failure, a deferred-update timeout, rapid navigation cancelling an active decoration, and an injected update-callback rejection completed without blocking the final route or producing unhandled rejections. |
| CSS extensions | Frame padding changed from 1px to 3px; opacity changed from 0.6 to 0.25 without new classes. Linear/radial/conic gradients rendered, custom easing resolved, and the solid reading surface inverted with color scheme. |
| Visual inspection | CSS-extension screenshots were inspected at 1280px dark and 320px light; the narrow page had no horizontal overflow. |
| Existing behavior | Tabs selected Activity; keyboard Switch state matched native `FormData`. Enhanced and no-JavaScript native POST failures preserved exact whitespace; enhanced failure focused the input and native success rendered its greeting. |

The hydrated normal, unsupported-API, and initial-reduced-motion runs recorded
no runtime/hydration errors. Fifteen scenario groups were retained in the review
evidence. A 13-section coverage audit had no batch errors, input exclusions, or
truncations; advisory safety/low-confidence flags were manually adjudicated
against sources, declarations, and the affected runtime cases, with no unresolved
concrete coverage finding.

These checks do **not** establish older-browser fallback coverage, production
Core Web Vitals, screen-reader announcements, full WCAG conformance, exhaustive
Marquee/FloatingPanel behavior, deployment, or every possible navigation race.
Fault injection tested decoration handling; it did not turn failed application
operations into successes. The temporary research and disposable fixture are not
required to consume this skill.

## Maintenance and future re-verification

1. Record date, runtime, package manager, exact resolved versions, lockfile, and
   workspace configuration. Do not generalize one fixture to an entire peer range.
2. Compare exact metadata, exports, declarations, source, and CSS with current v5
   docs. Use archives only for authorized staged migration. Review engines,
   optional peers, adapters, public entrypoints, tokens, and source detection.
3. Update every affected example, caller, reference, and task route together.
   Remove obsolete APIs rather than retaining compatibility shims.
4. In an authorized disposable fixture or application workflow, install without
   forced peers; extract complete documented examples/configuration. Run project
   checks and production build after edits finish. Record actual commands, results,
   warnings, and failures; do not predict counts.
5. Exercise hydration, repeated-instance associations, callback state, providers,
   keyboard/focus, overlays, responsive/theme/mode rendering, native/enhanced forms,
   raw failed values, and no-JavaScript behavior as applicable. Report browser and
   exact interactions; visual checks do not certify accessibility.
6. Verify request isolation, production adapter, and deployment target separately
   when required. Record unavailable checks and remaining limits explicitly.

## Portable distribution and installation

Distribute the entire `skeleton-svelte/` directory with `SKILL.md` and `references/`
intact. Follow the consumer host's documented skill-discovery instructions; retain
its directory name, relative links, and filenames. Do not ship only `SKILL.md`,
flatten references, or depend on authoring-workspace absolute paths.

There is no universal host-specific installation path in this format. Refresh
host discovery only when required. Installing the skill copies documentation,
not application dependencies or a verified toolchain, and does not mandate its use
for unrelated UI work. Bundled references and installed-package inspection work
offline; dependency installation uses the application's normal registry/cache.
