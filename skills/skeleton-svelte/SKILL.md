# Skeleton 5 for Svelte

Create coherent UI using Skeleton's theme vocabulary and the application's
visual language. Prefer styled native HTML for simple controls; use a verified
framework component when managed interaction requires it. React is out of scope.

## Version boundary: inspect before using examples

The exact reference baseline is **`@skeletonlabs/skeleton@5.0.1`** (CSS),
**`@skeletonlabs/skeleton-svelte@5.0.1`**, **Svelte `5.57.2`**,
**SvelteKit `3.1.0`**, and **Tailwind CSS `4.3.3`**.

- **Existing app:** require SvelteKit 3.1 or later. Inspect resolved versions;
  preserve compatible tooling, adapter, application conventions, and unrelated work.
  An older app needs the [prerequisite migration](references/migration.md), not
  a legacy-compatible implementation. Establish migration scope before editing it.
- **Later release:** retrieve matching primary documentation/types/source for
  affected APIs. The tested 3.1.0 baseline does not certify all future releases.
  Do not downgrade a supported app merely to copy an example.
- **Greenfield:** use [setup](references/setup.md); inspect scaffold output and
  dependency contracts rather than assuming CLI defaults. Never force peers.

## Read only the references needed for the task

Read the relevant sections, not the full reference set.

| Task | Reference and starting section |
| --- | --- |
| Installation or toolchain/CSS integration failure | [Setup](references/setup.md): version contract, existing or greenfield project, targeted diagnosis |
| Explicit Skeleton 2/3/4-to-5 or Kit 3 migration; mixed-major APIs | [Migration](references/migration.md): staged migration, affected configuration and every caller |
| Choose a control; verify exports, props, callbacks, anatomy | [Components](references/components.md): functional inventory, native alternatives, installed-types lookup |
| Implement a functional control; customize providers/elements | [Recipes](references/recipes.md) for complete controls; [Components](references/components.md#six-supported-composition-patterns) for provider/element patterns |
| Theme, tokens, brand presets, native classes, dark mode | [Styling](references/styling.md): theme registration, colors/presets, mode, diagnosis |
| Page composition, visual refinement, or performance | [Design](references/design.md): brief, visual system, purposeful feedback, performance constraints; app-shell recipe when useful |
| Labels, errors, keyboard/focus, contrast, continuous motion | [Accessibility](references/accessibility.md): relevant interaction contract and browser checks |
| Runes, SSR, lifecycle, route/load data, native server forms | [SvelteKit](references/sveltekit.md): selected framework boundary or example |
| Springs, transitions, attachments, or route view transitions | [SvelteKit](references/sveltekit.md#purposeful-motion): smallest mechanism, reduced motion, navigation lifecycle |
| Conflicting documentation, offline inspection, evidence | [Sources](references/sources.md): authority hierarchy, primary-source map, verification limits |

For a page refresh, combine **design + styling** and relevant accessibility
checks. Add **components + the selected recipe** for interaction, or **SvelteKit**
for server data/forms. An explicit migration needs **migration + setup** and each
affected control's contract. Do not copy the app shell merely to restyle a page.

## Blind-session workflow

Scale inspection to the request: a card restyle needs its markup, theme/CSS, and
relevant versions; setup or migration needs the full toolchain/configuration.

1. **Inspect and route.** Establish existing-app, greenfield, or migration scope.
   Distinguish manifest ranges from resolved versions. Inspect affected callers;
   read corresponding references. Preserve package manager and lockfile; merge
   configuration rather than replacing unrelated work.
2. **Calibrate the design.** Inspect representative screens, theme tokens, type,
   spacing, and density. Preserve the visual language unless redesign is requested.
   For new compositions, establish hierarchy, primary action, realistic states,
   and narrow/wide layouts before markup.
3. **Implement the verified contract.** Confirm exact declarations for changed
   APIs and source when types omit behavior. Adapt the selected recipe's labels,
   callbacks, anatomy, and rendered tags. Keep mutable state instance-owned.
   Preserve application validation/persistence; local previews do not save data.
4. **Verify affected behavior.** Use the project's authorized check/build workflow.
   For visual work, inspect narrow/wide rendering, contrast, and overflow. Exercise
   relevant keyboard/focus, state, native/enhanced form, and hydration checks from
   [accessibility](references/accessibility.md). Setup or migration also needs a
   production build and representative runtime smoke.
5. **Report evidence.** State checks actually performed and material limits.
   Compilation is not proof of visual quality, accessibility, persistence,
   deployment, or compatibility across an entire peer range.

## Version-specific traps

- **Modern framework conventions are mandatory.** Use the Vite-based Kit
  configuration, `$app/tsconfig`, `#lib/*`, `$app/env`, and `$app/state`.
  Historical conventions are migration inputs, never alternative target paths.
- **Use current public anatomy.** Callable roots such as `<Tabs>` and `<Dialog>`
  have verified child members; do not invent `.Root`. Tabs uses `.List`,
  `.Trigger`, and `.Content`, not old `.Control`/`.Panel` or list snippets.
  `Dialog`, `Toast`, `QrCode`, `Progress`, `RatingGroup`, and `SegmentedControl`
  are current names. `/composed`, `Modal`, and `Toaster` are obsolete destinations.
- **Props do not imply bindings.** Verified recipe roots use props/callbacks:
  Accordion `value: string[]` / `onValueChange(e.value)`, Switch
  `checked` / `onCheckedChange(e.checked)`. Native inputs support bindings.
  Verify other APIs individually; use `.Context` for an API getter when required.
- **Providers and custom elements have contracts.** Supply a hydration-stable
  `$props.id()` to `useTooltip` and similar factories; pass their API getter to
  `.Provider`, then call methods through the getter. An `element(attributes)`
  snippet replaces markup: spread all supplied attributes onto the real element.
  Do not nest a button inside a trigger that already renders one.
- **CSS is integration, not behavior.** Import Tailwind, Skeleton core, Skeleton
  Svelte CSS, and the chosen theme; activate matching `data-theme` on `<html>`.
  Presets are in core, not `/optional/presets`; framework CSS replaces the old
  Skeleton distribution scan. Retain `@source` for other shared UI when needed.
  Styled native form utilities require `@tailwindcss/forms`. CSS alone does not
  make a dialog modal or a styled disabled control semantically disabled.
- **Motion decorates real state.** Accessible values and success messages must
  report actual work, not animated interpolation. Honor reduced motion in CSS
  and JavaScript; preserve static feedback and normal-navigation fallbacks.
  Tailwind's browser baseline does not establish support for every Skeleton CSS
  feature. Test the application's cumulative browser requirements.
- **SSR must isolate users.** Keep mutable user state, dialogs, and toast queues
  per component/layout/request, not a shared server module. Guard browser-only
  work and clean it up. Initial markup and IDs must agree across hydration.
  Never disable app-wide SSR to hide one browser-only import. Preserve native
  POST forms, server validation, and exact raw failed values; enhance only
  supported POST page actions. See [SvelteKit](references/sveltekit.md).

## Evidence hierarchy and offline fallback

Use resolved installed exports/types/source/CSS for the actual API and exact
registry metadata for peers/engines. Current official **`skeleton.dev`** v5 docs
are relevant; archived v4 docs support only the staged migration to v5. Framework
docs must match the requested version. Search, Context7, supplied Gemini research,
and supplemental research are discovery/secondary evidence, not proof against
shipped declarations.

Offline, follow [components' installed-types lookup](references/components.md#offline-installed-types-lookup)
through the actual dependency layout. [Sources](references/sources.md) records
primary links, research corrections, and evidence limits. If evidence is missing,
name the unknown contract rather than inventing an API or claiming verification.
